# Data Modeling using Apache Cassandra

This repository contains code for transferring raw data from a set of CSV files into Apache Cassandra tables. To support greater availability, the data has been denormalized and modelled keeping in mind the queries that need to be executed.

Please refer to the [Jupyter Notebook file](Apache_Cassandra_ETL_pipeline.ipynb) for a step-by-step guideline of the process.
